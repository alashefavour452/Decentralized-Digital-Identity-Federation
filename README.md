# Decentralized Digital Identity Federation (DDIF)

## Overview

The Decentralized Digital Identity Federation (DDIF) is a blockchain-based framework designed to establish trust and interoperability between disparate identity systems. By leveraging distributed ledger technology, DDIF enables secure, privacy-preserving identity verification across organizational boundaries without requiring centralized control.

## Core Components

### 1. Identity Provider Verification
Validates the legitimacy of credential issuers within the federation, ensuring that only authorized entities can issue identity credentials. This component maintains a registry of verified issuers with their public keys and trust scores.

### 2. Cross-Domain Trust Contract
Manages trust relationships between different identity systems and domains. This smart contract defines the rules for establishing, maintaining, and revoking trust between participating entities in the federation.

### 3. Attribute Mapping Contract
Standardizes identity claims and attributes across heterogeneous systems. This component provides a common semantic layer that translates different attribute schemas into a unified format, enabling interoperability between systems with different data models.

### 4. Authentication Protocol Contract
Manages secure login and authentication processes across the federation. This contract defines the protocols for credential presentation, verification, and authentication flows while protecting user privacy.

### 5. Audit Trail Contract
Records identity verification activities across the federation in a tamper-evident manner. This component provides transparency and accountability while maintaining appropriate privacy controls.

## Technical Architecture

The DDIF is built on a blockchain infrastructure that provides:

- **Decentralization**: No single point of failure or control
- **Immutability**: Tamper-evident record of identity transactions
- **Privacy-preservation**: Selective disclosure and minimal data sharing
- **Interoperability**: Standard protocols for cross-domain communication
- **Scalability**: Designed to accommodate millions of identities and transactions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14+)
- Blockchain development environment (Truffle/Hardhat)
- Web3 provider credentials

### Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/your-organization/ddif.git
cd ddif
npm install
```

### Configuration
1. Set up your blockchain provider in `config.js`
2. Deploy the smart contracts to your preferred network:
```
npm run deploy
```
3. Configure the identity provider verification parameters in `providers-config.js`

## Usage Examples

### Registering an Identity Provider
```javascript
const DDIF = require('ddif-sdk');
const ddif = new DDIF.Client(config);

await ddif.registerProvider({
  name: "University of Example",
  publicKey: "0x...",
  domainName: "university.example",
  attestationDocuments: ["0x..."]
});
```

### Creating a Cross-Domain Trust Relationship
```javascript
await ddif.createTrustRelationship({
  providerA: "0x...", // Provider ID
  providerB: "0x...", // Provider ID
  trustLevel: 3,       // 1-5 scale
  attributeAccess: ["name", "dateOfBirth", "educationLevel"]
});
```

### Verifying a Credential Across Domains
```javascript
const verificationResult = await ddif.verifyCredential({
  credential: "0x...",
  presentationContext: "job-application",
  requiredTrustLevel: 2
});

if (verificationResult.isValid) {
  // Process the verified identity
}
```

## Security Considerations

- All private keys should be properly secured and never exposed
- Implement proper access controls for admin functions
- Regular security audits of smart contracts are recommended
- Follow best practices for key management and rotation

## Roadmap

- [ ] Mobile SDK for credential holders
- [ ] Enhanced privacy features using zero-knowledge proofs
- [ ] Governance framework for federation participants
- [ ] Integration with existing identity standards (DID, VC)
- [ ] Selective disclosure improvements
